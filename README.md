# curnelo

An implementation of the Curnel of [Cur, a dependently-typed programming language](https://github.com/wilbowma/cur), in miniKanren.

Curnelo forms the basis for a new user-defined language layer on top of Cur's trusted core language.
It adds a general purposes unification framework atop Cur, enabling features like type inference,
proof search/program synthesis (holes), and universe constraint solving.

Code by William J. Bowman, Michael Ballantyne, and Will Byrd.
